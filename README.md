## 💡 Why I Built This

I looked everywhere for a simple, premium chess app to play on my phone, but every site out there was loaded with annoying ads, required a login, or was too clunky for mobile. So, I built the ultimate version myself. No ads, no paywalls, just pure chess packed into a lightning-fast web app.

## ✨ Elite Features

* 🤖 **Built-in AI Opponent:** Practice your openings against a custom Minimax algorithm with adjustable difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard).
* 🔄 **Tabletop Mode (Smart Spin):** The board stays static, but the pieces seamlessly rotate 180° after every move so your opponent never plays upside down.
* 🎨 **Premium Themes:** Switch between Classic Green, Walnut Wood, Midnight Blue, and Bubblegum instantly.
* ⏱️ **Precision Timers:** Built-in support for Blitz (3m/5m), Rapid (10m), or unlimited time modes.
* 📱 **Haptic Feedback & Audio:** Satisfying physical vibrations and crisp synthesized audio for moves, captures, and checks.
* 🚫 **Zero Ads & Zero Clutter:** A pro-grade, distraction-free dark UI designed for total focus.
* 📋 **PGN Export:** Instantly copy the match's official Algebraic Notation to your clipboard for post-game analysis.
* ⏪ **Full Match Control:** Undo, Redo, Pause, Draw, and Resign functionalities built directly into the HUD.
* ⚡ **Ultra-Lightweight:** 100% Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No heavy frameworks—in fact, the entire app runs from a **single file**.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Run Locally)

Because **Chess Anywhere** is built with raw, vanilla web tech, there are no complicated build steps. Just copy the code and run it in your browser!
